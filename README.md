This program allows **DISCO-L4S5I** to read sensor values and send datas to server through wifi. 
Server will recieve the data and visualize them.

To run the program, there're few steps to be done:
1. Create an empty project
2. Replace the origin ```main.cpp``` by the one here
3. Put both ```BSP_B-L475E-IOT01``` folder and ```mbed-dsp``` into your program folder
4. Run the program
5. Then we may see the result printed in the console


**We use Matlab to visualize our data, you may choose your prefer way to do it yourself.**
